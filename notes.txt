Class Diagram Changes Needed
----------------------------
ParameterSet.adjustParameters() has changed
  same with ParameterArea
View.actionPerformed(e) is now public
View implements ActionListener
all of the Timer functions need renaming to match javax.swing.Timer
Simulation needs to be an observable, not Field
Ant.followPheromones() name and parameter change
Ant.stuff : change public/private ; add update()
  -same for Predator and Colony
GridUnit:
 - this stays on the diagram, but only "Pheromone" stays connected to it
 - colony and foodpile need to have location, now
 - update Field accordingly
 add the Field get/set/decay parameters methods


Prototyping not finished
------------------------
View still needs to be an Observer, and Simulation an observable
PopupWindow still needs to be created
