Class Diagram Changes Needed
----------------------------
ParameterSet.adjustParameters() has changed
  same with ParameterArea
View.actionPerformed(e) is now public
View implements ActionListener
all of the Timer functions need renaming to match javax.swing.Timer
Simulation needs to be an observable, not Field


Prototyping not finished
------------------------
View still needs to be an Observer, and Simulation an observable
PopupWindow still needs to be created


GridUnit
--------
This system sucks.
  We should make Foodpiles and Colonies like Ants and Predators, with a location
  We can make pheromones into an array under Field: int pheromones[faction][width][height];  Use examples:
    Field.decayParameters();
	Ant.dropPheromone() -> Field.setPheromone(ant.x,ant.y,ant.faction,strength)
    Ant.followPheromone() -> checks Field.pheromoneAt(someX,someY,ant.faction) for a few locations to decide where to go
