STUFF TO DO
-----------
Joseph
  -grid centers in the view
  -update documents
  -make Controller not an applet -> nevermind!
  -remove "generate output" button
  -make sure there are NO GLOBALS
  -add comments around some points of code to help keep it clear for the grader what we're trying

Brian
	-clean up ant movement
		-I think ants wanter one to far
	-clean code so primvate functions are used
	-kill predators

Cameron
	DONE-pheromone display
	DONE-ParameterSetTest will need fixing 
	-image display (NEED IMAGES FIRST)

Steve
	-improve dispaly
		make ants scale with the grid
		   "I believe ants already scale with the size of the grid. The larger the area the smaller the ants. Note how they always fit nicely inside the grid?" --Cameron
	-make images
		lower priority (scaling sucks)
		
Benjamin
	-make sure that unneccecary parameters are trimmed
	-make sure all changes suggested in A5 are applied (ie, field.width -> field.getWidth())
	-test all neccecary parameters, that they work; find reasonalbe MIN_VALS and MAX_VALS
			
OTHERS
------
-JUnit Testing!!
-make the simulation stop itself when all ants are dead and all colonies depleted
	(pass a new command to the controller?)
	low priority

Diagram Changes Needed
----------------------------
+parameters -> -parameters
add +generateFromFile()
everything under View
ParameterArea.editable -> killed
View and Parameterset: use File, not String

JUnit Testing needed (/ideas)
-----------------------------
-setting the status label
