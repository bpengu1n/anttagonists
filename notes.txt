STUFF TO DO
-----------
 
ASK ALI:
	do we need to include getters and setters in the class diagrams?

Joseph
  -update documents
		"Ants do not eat outside the nest."
		"Ants do not seek the nest, even when hungry, unless they have food.  However, they will eat if they stumble upon the nest while hungry."
  -JUnit Test for setStatus

Brian
	???

Cameron
	-image display (NEED IMAGES FIRST)

Steve
	-make images
		lower priority (scaling sucks to do)
		
Benjamin
	-make sure that unneccecary parameters are trimmed
	-make sure all changes suggested in A5 are applied
	-test all neccecary parameters, that they work; find reasonalbe MIN_VALS and MAX_VALS
			
OTHERS
------
-JUnit Testing!!
   -split out the old tests ("One assertion for one test case")
   -add new tests ("Every test case has a self-descriptive name")
-make ants less curious when they have food (lower priority)
-make the simulation stop itself when all ants are dead and all colonies depleted
	(pass a new command to the controller?)
	low priority

Diagram Changes Needed
----------------------------
+parameters -> -parameters
add +generateFromFile()
everything under View
ParameterArea.editable -> killed
View and Parameterset: use File, not String

JUnit Testing needed (/ideas)
-----------------------------
