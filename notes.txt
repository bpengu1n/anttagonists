STUFF TO DO
-----------
Brian
	-drop and display pheromones
Cameron
	-ParameterSetTest will need fixing (line 28 once read as follows):
		public float expectedValue = ParameterSet.PARAMETER_DEFAULT_VALUE;
		I just put in a constant, so it would compile.  But it is wrong.

OTHERS - Please Claim
-Add an output file
		-see the input file stuff to get an idea how, or just look online.

-improve dispaly
	make ants scale with the grid

-make the simulation stop itself when all ants are dead and all colonies depleted
	(pass a new command to the controller?)
