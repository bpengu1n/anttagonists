STUFF TO DO
-----------
Brian
	-drop and display pheromones
Cameron
	-make the HUD togglable
	-make Gridlines toggleable
  	-DON'T draw these in update().  Draw them in paintComponent().  That way, even if the simulation is paused, it can be updated
	-ParameterSetTest will need fixing (line 28 once read as follows):
		public float expectedValue = ParameterSet.PARAMETER_DEFAULT_VALUE;
		I just put in a constant, so it would compile.  But it is wrong.

OTHERS - Please Claim
-Add an output file
		-see the input file stuff to get an idea how, or just look online.

-improve dispaly
	make ants scale with the grid

-make the simulation stop itself when all ants are dead and all colonies depleted
	(pass a new command to the controller?)


Diagram Changes Needed
----------------------------
+parameters -> -parameters
add +generateFromFile()
everything under View
ParameterArea.editable -> killed
View and Parameterset: use File, not String

JUnit Testing needed (/ideas)
-----------------------------
-setting the status label
