STUFF TO DO
-----------
Joseph
  -grid centers in the view
  -update documents
  -make Controller not an applet -> nevermind!
  -remove "generate output" button
  -make sure there are NO GLOBALS
  -add comments around some points of code to help keep it clear for the grader what we're trying

Brian
	-clean up ant movement
		-I think ants wanter one to far
	-clean code so primvate functions are used
	-kill predators

Cameron
	-pheromone display
	-image display
	-ParameterSetTest will need fixing (line 28 once read as follows):
		public float expectedValue = ParameterSet.PARAMETER_DEFAULT_VALUE;
			I just put in a constant, so it would compile.  But it is wrong.
		-> or just delete the thing, or replace it with something different

Steve
	-improve dispaly
		make ants scale with the grid
	-make images
		lower priority (scaling sucks)
		
Benjamin
	-make sure that unneccecary parameters are trimmed
	-make sure all changes suggested in A5 are applied (ie, field.width -> field.getWidth())
	-test all neccecary parameters, that they work; find reasonalbe MIN_VALS and MAX_VALS
			
OTHERS
------
-JUnit Testing!!
-make the simulation stop itself when all ants are dead and all colonies depleted
	(pass a new command to the controller?)
	low priority

Diagram Changes Needed
----------------------------
+parameters -> -parameters
add +generateFromFile()
everything under View
ParameterArea.editable -> killed
View and Parameterset: use File, not String

JUnit Testing needed (/ideas)
-----------------------------
-setting the status label
